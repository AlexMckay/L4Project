This helps to setup the project using Eclipse.
This requires 2 IP libraries which are included in the zip.(jai_imageio.jar and clibwrapper_jiio.jar)
If you are not using eclipse, please add these 2 libraries to your project.

After opening Eclipse:

1. Goto File->New->Java Project
2. In the "contents" section, select the radio button "create project from existing source"
3. Click browse to point to the downloaded ImgProcTool folder (Assuming u have unzipped the file)
4. Click Finish on the "new Java Project" window.

TEST IT BY EXECUTING THE PROJECT

5. Right click on the project and select "Run as->java application"
6. If everything is fine, there will be console output ending with "Done".
7. Refresh the project, you will see a new .pgm file "lena_write.pgm".
